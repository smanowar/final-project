# Final Project: First Segment Project Deliverable

## Selected Topic: Stack Overflow Response Analysis

## Overview

  As students who use stack overflow as a learning tool, we want data on the best times to be online and post our questions to get an approved answer quickly and keep our momentum as we learn. The purpose of this project is to determine the relationships between the features on Stack Overflow such as time of day, tags, question creation date in order to help users make the most of their studying time.

## Questions we hope to answer

- What are factors that lead to short times to approved answers?
- What is the mean time between question and approved answer?
- What is the median time between question and approved answer?
- What are the top ten times of day where the most questions are posed?
- What are the top ten times of day where the most approved answers are provided?
- What times of each day sees response rates of less than an hour?
- What is the mean time between question and approved answer by tag?
- What is the median time between question and approved answer by tag?
- What is the correlation between tag popularity and time to an approved answer?
- What is the correlation between the number of tags and time to an approved answer? 
- Do the number of tags impact the number of approved responses?
- What is the correlation between the badged questions and time to an approved answer?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The data was obtained from Google Could Marketplace() and Kaggle(link).

## Machine Learning Component
## **Provisional Machine Learning Model**

In order to determine the most appropriate model for the Stack Overflow data we exlpored relationships between various features within the data and the estimated response time. By using a regression model we established that there was no correlation between the features that were used in the regression model. 

We arrived at this conclusion via the following steps:

Moving forward in project, we will explore the inclusion of other features as well as different machine learning models.
