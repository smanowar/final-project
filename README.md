# Final Project: Analyzing StackOverflow Messageboard Data

## Machine Learning Component
### *Unsupervised Learning - Clustering using the K-Means Algorithm*

For the machine learning component of this project we have decided to use clustering using the k-means algorithm to analyze our data.

We opted for an unsupervised machine learning model as the initial question we wanted to answer was: *" What time of day and day of the week are questions most likley to get an approved response?"*

The features we will use to explore this are:
- the day of the week the question was posted
- the time of day the question was posted

We will use Jupyter Notebook to complete our analysis.

**Steps to take:**

*1. Import Dependencies*
    - sklearn libraries
    - pandas and hv.plot
    - path
    - plotly
*2. Clean/Prep Data for Analysis*
    - drop necessary columns
    - join tables 
    - use get_dummies() or use a numerical transformation on text features 
    - standardize data using StandardScaler()
*3. (tentative) Use PCA to Reduce Dimensions*

*4. Implement Clustering Algorithm using K-Means*

*5. Plot Results*
