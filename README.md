# Final Project: Analyzing StackOverflow Messageboard Data

## Machine Learning Component
### *Unsupervised Learning - Clustering using the K-Means Algorithm*

For the machine learning component of this project we have decided to use clustering using the k-means algorithm to analyze our data.

We opted for an unsupervised machine learning model as the initial question we wanted to answer was: 
<p align = "center">
    <b>"What time of day and day of the week are questions most likley to get an approved response?"</b>
    </p>
    
The features we will use to explore this are:
- the day of the week the question was posted
- the time of day the question was posted

We will use Jupyter Notebook to complete our analysis.

### **Steps to take:**

**1. Import Dependencies**<br>
- sklearn libraries<br>
- pandas and hv.plot<br>
- path<br>
- plotly<br>

**2. Clean/Prep Data for Analysis**<br>
- drop necessary columns<br>
- join tables <br>
- use get_dummies() or use a numerical transformation on text features <br>
- standardize data using StandardScaler()<br>

**3. (tentative) Use PCA to Reduce Dimensions**

**4. Implement Clustering Algorithm using K-Means**

**5. Plot Results**
