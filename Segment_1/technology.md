# Technologies Used

## First Deliverable

### Technologies Used
#### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage
BigQuery (Google Cloud Platform) is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Jupyter Notebook to display the data.

#### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a first draft of a model. 

#### Dashboard
We haven't created a dashboard as part of this deliverable.
